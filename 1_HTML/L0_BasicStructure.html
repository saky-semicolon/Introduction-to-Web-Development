<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
    Doctype HTML is a declaration that tells the browser what version of HTML the document is written in.
    This declaration appears as the very first line in an HTML file.
-->

<html lang="en">
<!-- 
    It is the HTML tag that shows HTML has been started from this place. 
    The lang attribute specifies the language of the element's content.
    Common examples are "en" for English, "es" for Spanish, "fr" for French and so on.
 -->
<head>
    <!-- 
        The <head> tag in HTML is used to define the head portion of the document which contains information related to the document.
        The <head> tag contains other head elements such as <title>, <meta>, <link>, <style> <link> etc. In HTML 4.01 the <head> element was mandatory but in HTML5, the <head> element can be omitted.
     -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- 
        The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
        The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!
        UTF-8 is the most widely used way to represent Unicode text in web pages, and you should always use UTF-8 when creating your web pages and databases.
        But, in principle, UTF-8 is only one of the possible ways of encoding Unicode characters.

        The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

    <title>Document</title>
    <!--
